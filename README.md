# VisualBasicPrograms
Some of my programs I made in Visual Basic 2008 and Visual Basic 2010!
# tiny agreement
You MAY NOT take these programs, rename them, and claim them as yours. If I find these programs anywhere else then my websites or the GitHub repository. someone is in some BIG TROUBLE.
# Other stuff
These programs are either USELESS or USEFULL. Some are for fun (e.g. SignIN) some are just random (e.g. Speaker) or useful (e.g. no example).
So don't scream at me "THEY ARE USELESS" cuz i know.
